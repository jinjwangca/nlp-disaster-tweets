# NLP Disaster Tweet Classification

This project is a mini Kaggle challenge for classifying whether a tweet is about a real disaster or not. It serves as an introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sequence modeling using deep learning.

## ML Models
Bidirectional LSTM Neural Network
- Built using TensorFlow/Keras
- Includes an Embedding layer, stacked Bidirectional LSTM layers, Dropout for regularization, and Dense layers for binary classification  

## Files
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook
- `images/`: Model result plots
- `data/`: Training set and test set
